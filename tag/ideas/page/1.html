So, I went through \u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview\"\u003eGoogle technical writing course\u003c/a\u003e and did exercises there on how to write better text. Did I start to communicate better? Barely, I still prefer to write code instead of long Jira issue descriptions or design documents with proposals for new features. Maybe it is because I type slowly (60 wpm). This is better than 90% or something of the population, but the general population does not spend most of their working day behind the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another article on that blog, \u003ca href=\"https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9087\"\u003ehow to increase your typing speed\u003c/a\u003e, which linked to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ArVtCQqQRE\"\u003ea video with tips to improve typing speed\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnX63qh0EfM\"\u003evideo blog of a guy who increased his speed from 50 wpm to 100 wpm\u003c/a\u003e, and I thought that maybe I should to try to reach 100 wpm speed too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I went to \u003ca href=\"https://www.keybr.com/\"\u003ekeybr.com\u003c/a\u003e, and already spent in a total of 2 hours practicing there, and my current record is 90.6 wpm. Not yet 100, but very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeybr generates random texts (with \"words\" made from random characters) by using statistics on how you type, to train your weakest keys. I think this approach is good and will get me to 100 wpm there in a month or so of focused practice. But it could be improved further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, keybr.com has no special characters, which are critical for a programmer. And even for a writer. When I write this in markdown, I use square brackets to add links, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, the text is different every time, and you could not repeat the same text to see how you improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have read about \u003ca href=\"https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2201-training-with-amphetype/\"\u003ean interesting method on the forum about Colemak keyboard layout\u003c/a\u003e, called \"type-reading\", where you type some interesting book paragraph by paragraph, so you train your typing at the same time as you read it. And suggestion to use this to learn some poems. I think it is a very nice idea, which could help me to learn some German. (If you are wondering, no, I'm not going to learn Colemak or Dvorak, I switch Ctrl and Fn keys on my computers, to have Ctrl on the lower-left corner, and that is enough pain when I'm using someone's computer, or when someone uses mine).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd third, it would be nice to have statistics on only on separate keys, but for trigrams or some kind of n-grams (I'm not sure which n would be optimal). And given some text, it should calculate optimal exercise to speed-up typing that text the most. Keeping in the account that the fastest trigrams are hardest to speedup, but the most frequent ones will influence overall typing speed at most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it should be some console program, so anytime I could type the command:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003etypetrainer add if_kipling if.txt\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it will add lessons based on that poem to the set of lessons. And then to test \u0026#x26; train run:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003etypetrainer test if_kipling\ntypetrainer train if_kipling\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd training session will be generated with randomly selected trigrams, where the probability of each trigram to appear next is probably the frequency of that trigram in sample text divided by the speed with which it is typed measured in our average trigram speed (the faster we type the less it is needed to be improved).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for each trigram, we keep per-lesson stats, and global stats, of maybe 10 last typing speeds in the ring buffer, so we have a moving average of 10 values instead of the last value, which could get pretty noisy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe https://github.com/pb-/gotypist could be updated to be like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe I should fist focus on achieving 100 wpm speed on keybr.com, and finishing SICP. I have many interests, sometimes they conflict, as Smixx would rap in \"Developers\".\u003c/p\u003e"}],"pages":1,"archives":[{"url":"/month/2021-10/page/1","id":"2021-10","count":1,"title":"2021-10"},{"url":"/month/2021-01/page/1","id":"2021-01","count":4,"title":"2021-01"},{"url":"/month/2020-12/page/1","id":"2020-12","count":1,"title":"2020-12"},{"url":"/month/2020-09/page/1","id":"2020-09","count":2,"title":"2020-09"},{"url":"/month/2020-08/page/1","id":"2020-08","count":2,"title":"2020-08"},{"url":"/month/2020-07/page/1","id":"2020-07","count":10,"title":"2020-07"},{"url":"/month/2020-06/page/1","id":"2020-06","count":7,"title":"2020-06"},{"url":"/month/2018-12/page/1","id":"2018-12","count":1,"title":"2018-12"}],"topics":[{"url":"/tag/MOOC/page/1","id":"MOOC","title":"MOOC","count":2},{"url":"/tag/SICP/page/1","id":"SICP","title":"SICP","count":20},{"url":"/tag/asm/page/1","id":"asm","title":"asm","count":1},{"url":"/tag/ideas/page/1","id":"ideas","title":"ideas","count":1},{"url":"/tag/notes/page/1","id":"notes","title":"notes","count":6},{"url":"/tag/on writing/page/1","id":"on writing","title":"on writing","count":3}],"tag":"ideas"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/tag/[tag]/page/[page]","query":{"tag":"ideas","page":"1"},"buildId":"vTIm-6E4fBbgVLRlj9tfU","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
