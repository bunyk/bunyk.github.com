What they know, what they need to learn?</li>\n<li>Define unfamiliar terms or link to their definition.</li>\n<li>Use acronyms only if you define it first, it appears often in document and is significantly shorter than full text.</li>\n<li>Make sure pronouns are unambiguous. Replace them (pronouns) with nouns when necessary.</li>\n<li>Active voice is better then passive.</li>\n<li>Avoid imprecise verbs - forms of \"be\", \"occur\", \"happen\". Remove \"there is\".</li>\n<li>Remove unnecessary words. Reduce wordiness.\n<ul>\n<li>Is able to -> can</li>\n<li>at this time -> now</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Minimize adjectives and adverbs in educational texts.</li>\n<li>Avoid idioms.\n<ul>\n<li>piece of cake -> easy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Write short sentences. Each sentence should focus on single idea.</li>\n<li>Convert some long sentences to lists.</li>\n<li>Use bulleted lists for unordered items and numbered for ordered. If meaning of list changes from reordering - it should be numbered.</li>\n<li>Opening sentence of each paragraph should define what paragraph will be about.</li>\n<li>Each paragraph should be about separate topic.</li>\n<li>Each paragraph should answer 3 questions. (I am not very convinced about this).\n<ol>\n<li><em>What</em> you are telling your reader?</li>\n<li><em>Why</em> it is important?</li>\n<li><em>How</em> reader should use that knowledge? Or how should he know it is true?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Minimize use of parentheses. (They contain text that is not critical, so either text, or them could be removed.)</li>\n<li>Turn on spellchecking. (My addition).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vim users spellcheck like this:</p>\n<pre><code>:set spell spelllang=en_us\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>]s</code> moves you to next misspelled word. <code>[s</code> - to previous. <code>z=</code> gives you a list of suggestions.</p>"},"archives":[{"url":"/month/2018-12/page/1","id":"2018-12","count":1,"title":"2018-12"},{"url":"/month/2020-06/page/1","id":"2020-06","count":7,"title":"2020-06"},{"url":"/month/2020-07/page/1","id":"2020-07","count":10,"title":"2020-07"},{"url":"/month/2020-08/page/1","id":"2020-08","count":2,"title":"2020-08"},{"url":"/month/2020-09/page/1","id":"2020-09","count":2,"title":"2020-09"},{"url":"/month/2020-12/page/1","id":"2020-12","count":1,"title":"2020-12"},{"url":"/month/2021-01/page/1","id":"2021-01","count":4,"title":"2021-01"}],"topics":[{"url":"/tag/MOOC/page/1","id":"MOOC","title":"MOOC","count":2},{"url":"/tag/SICP/page/1","id":"SICP","title":"SICP","count":20},{"url":"/tag/ideas/page/1","id":"ideas","title":"ideas","count":1},{"url":"/tag/notes/page/1","id":"notes","title":"notes","count":5},{"url":"/tag/on writing/page/1","id":"on writing","title":"on writing","count":3}]},"__N_SSG":true}
