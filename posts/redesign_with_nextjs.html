But most probably you did not, because you are first time here. It's normal, blogs are in decline probably since Google closed it's Reader service. Which was probably not a cause but symptom of that decline. And I do not even have RSS/Atom here (yet?).</p>
<p>Anyway, my site here changed designs very often. First it was self-made static site generator in python that resolved JS dependencies. Then I added bootstrap. Then removed bootstrap. Then I got rid of my own generator and used Hugo. It looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/content/HugoTheme.png" alt="Old design with Hugo" title="Old design with Hugo"></p>
<p>I used it for couple of years, but did not like it for this reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could not just add a file to posts folder, and expect post to appear, I need to use some Hugo command that creates it, with front-matter and other stuff.</li>
<li>After post is created as a draft, I'm not sure how to change it's publication date. Just changing date in front-matter does not work. Some of my posts stay in draft phase for years (at least on Wordpress blog, here a little bit less, since even drafts could be regarded as published, if you push blog source files to GitHub.)</li>
<li>Working with JS in Hugo and it's templates (go templates), is not much pleasure.</li>
<li>Hugo is described as " The world’s fastest framework for building websites", but I don't care much about that yet. Maybe I'll care after I have a 1000 posts, but currently I don't mind waiting a couple of seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>But most important reason to switch was that I wanted to try to write something in React, and make this blog more dynamic.</p>
<p>So I took the content of my blog as it was, markdown files with YAML front-matter. Then wrote some JS functions that load and query that files and transform markdown into HTML, and used that data as arguments to react components that build my blog. I also used Material UI components. It looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/content/MaterialUIBlog.png" alt="Old design with MaterialUI" title="Old design with MaterialUI"></p>
<p>Then, I saw my blog on various devices, and noticed that since I have not a lot of skills in UI, my blog is not as responsive as I wanted it to be. And then, I thought, that given amount of content I have there is no much utility from tags or monthly archives, and got rid of them. Than it looked like Material UI is overkill for what was left there. So, I took inspiration from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/</a>, and implemented my own theme in a under 30 lines of unminified CSS:</p>

<p>And navigation here is could not be more simpler. You have <a href="/">home page</a> that links to every post. Every post links back to it. Period.</p>
<p>Now the missing features are comments, analytics and RSS. And fix rendering of LaTeX.</p>
<p>Comments are probably most important, because otherwise I'll not be able to receive feedback. And without anyone telling me that I'm writing some bullshit - how would I improve my writing? I'm thinking to maybe build something using Google docs (<a href="https://jdvp.me/articles/Google-Forms-Jekyll-Comments-Revisited">Article about implementing comments for Jekyll blog using Google Forms</a>), but that will take more time. Maybe I'll enable Disqus again.
