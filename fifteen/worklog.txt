11:29 How to create 15-puzzle?
11:31 Use some framework? 
11:31 No, let use just plain coffescript and SVG.

11:32 From where to start? 
11:32 Let's draw field, or some SVG on page.

11:45 How to center text in SVG? 
11:49 text-anchor="middle"

11:50 How to draw multiple tiles? 
11:56 Draw them using function, and transform="translate()" attr in group

12:06 If tile exists, how to not draw duplicate? 
12:27 Search tile by id, and if exists just update transform.

12:27 Field is not drawn, using functions. Why? 
12:29 DOM is build, and supposingly correctly, but not visible. Why? 
12:34 If hardcode generated DOM into HTML code, it renders. But inserted using jQuery - not. Why?
12:37 Because when we pass marcup into $, to create element, it parses as HTML, and know nothing about SVG namespace.

12:41 What we could use instead of jQuery? 
12:45 D3 may be? 
13:22 Or better Raphael? 
13:37 Ok, D3, but we need to rewrite our SVG in group into chain of append() and attr() calls.

13:55 How to center text vertically in SVG? 
13:58 dominant-baseline="middle"

14:04 How to know on which tile user clicked?
14:08 tiles.on('click', (d) -> ... d is data. Nice.

14:09 How to move tiles accordingly to the click? 
14:27 Better rewrite field as object instead as array of arrays, to incapsulate actions on it.

16:58 Ok, it works. What next? 
17:00 Make shuffle only generate solvable permutations,
    add to site menu,
    add "Solved! screen",
    add moves counter,
    add visual buttons,
