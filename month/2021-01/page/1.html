<p>I would rearrange notes in order that seems more logical for the writing process, not in the order information was provided in course.</p>
<p>In general writing process could be organized in following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading. To be a good writer you need to be active reader.</li>
<li>Prewriting. All the stuff you do before you get down to actual writing.</li>
<li>Writing draft, trying to use correct vocabulary.</li>
<li>Revision of that draft to produce next draft with fixed writing problems.</li>
<li>Repeating step 4 again for more low-level improvements of text (editing).</li>
</ol>
<p>This steps and ways to get better at them will be detailed in sections below.</p></div><div class="MuiCardActions-root MuiCardActions-spacing"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-text" tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="/posts/edx_writing"><span class="MuiButton-label">More</span></a></div></div><button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-text Mui-disabled Mui-disabled" tabindex="-1" type="button" disabled=""><span class="MuiButton-label">1</span></button></div><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-12 MuiGrid-grid-md-3"><h6 class="MuiTypography-root jss5 MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Archives</h6><ul><li><a href="/month/2021-10/page/1">2021-10</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->1<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2021-01/page/1">2021-01</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->4<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2020-12/page/1">2020-12</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->1<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2020-09/page/1">2020-09</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->2<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2020-08/page/1">2020-08</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->2<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2020-07/page/1">2020-07</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->10<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2020-06/page/1">2020-06</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->7<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/month/2018-12/page/1">2018-12</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->1<!-- -->)</span></li></ul><h6 class="MuiTypography-root jss5 MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom">Topics</h6><ul><li><a href="/tag/MOOC/page/1">MOOC</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->2<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/tag/SICP/page/1">SICP</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->20<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/tag/asm/page/1">asm</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->1<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/tag/ideas/page/1">ideas</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->1<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/tag/notes/page/1">notes</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->6<!-- -->)</span></li><li><a href="/tag/on%20writing/page/1">on writing</a> <span title="posts count">(<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</span></li></ul></div><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 MuiTypography-colorTextSecondary MuiTypography-alignCenter">© <!-- -->2021<!-- --> Bunyk Taras.

He argues that most people write only transient (temporary) notes. Transient notes usually serve only as aid to working memory. Some people try to improve efficiency of transient note taking. This is not very effective, because they focus on improving the tool of note taking, while improvement effort should be focused on better thinking. And transient notes lack useful feedback, so people often plateau in their writing skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvergreen notes are derived from Zettelkasten (note boxes) system, created by Niklas Luhmann. He was a very productive sociologist, who, with the help of his system, published about 70 books. Andy adds, that unlike other people who write articles about note-taking, he actually achieved something in other fields using his tool, while main job of note-taking article authors is writing about note taking \u0026#x26; other life hacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePrinciples\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvergreen notes are built on following principles:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are \u003cstrong\u003eatomic\u003c/strong\u003e. Each note is about one thing, but comprehensive. Think about them as software modules, keeping in mind coupling and cohesion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are \u003cstrong\u003econcept-oriented\u003c/strong\u003e. You don't write evergreen note about one book or author, you write it about one idea, and when you read another book on topic - add to existing note.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are \u003cstrong\u003edensely linked\u003c/strong\u003e. When you write about idea - think about how it relates to other ideas. Building links will make you reread existing notes, which in turn will work as a form of spaced repetition. Links not necessary have to be made to existing notes, they could serve as a writing backlog for the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAssociative ontologies\u003c/strong\u003e (graphs) are better than hierarchical taxonomies (trees). Structure of notes should emerge organically, and not be enforced in advance. Tags are ineffective in organizing knowledge, because they do not add weight (measure of how much something belongs to a tag) to association. Labeled associations are better: why is this associated with that?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eProcess\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite about what you read\u003c/strong\u003e. This will increase your understanding of topic, and you will forget less. Also, if you write about what you read, you will not just repeat someones neural process, but process it yourself and may be have another conclusions. Process of writing about reading has two steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWrite annotations \u0026#x26; observations while you read. Bookmark some pages, write down quotes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProcess list of annotations into evergreen notes for each concept.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaintain \u003cstrong\u003ereading backlog\u003c/strong\u003e - anything you will read soon. If you are not reading something for a long time - remove it from reading backlog (but you could keep a reference to it in some evergreen note).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaintain \u003cstrong\u003ewriting backlog\u003c/strong\u003e. Regularly go over your transient notes and discard unimportant, or add important stuff to evergreen notes. Finish unfinished evergreen notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you need to write about some topic, starting with evergreen notes will be easier then starting from the blank page:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReview notes related to topic and probably also related to them. Reviewing notes could cause some interesting new ideas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWrite outline.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAttach existing notes to outline, add missing notes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConcatenate whole text.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRewrite.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMy ramblings on possible implementations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy Matushak uses his own proprietary software for his system. I think it would be not hard to implement with just any tool that could process markdown. But of course any tool that will help with adding links, indexing and tracking backlinks would be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it could be done in TiddlyWiki and I should give it another try. I used it to aid me with onboarding into my current job, and it was not bad, if you don't count that it uses markup language different from markdown and MediaWiki, and I found it hard to compile some publishable documentation for intranet from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it could be small program that maps folder with markdown files into set of HTML pages with computed backlinks \u0026#x26; index. Maybe that program would also have an interface to edit markdown and see result in split view, and also update markdown file on server? Or something like MediaWiki? Maybe something simpler than MediaWiki, as it requires lots of infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have this idea of an application that stores notes on an infinite 2d plane. Something like digital \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_board\"\u003eevidence board\u003c/a\u003e in style of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsn_(file_manager)\"\u003efsn file manager\u003c/a\u003e. Notes have coordinates, width and height. (Maybe also rotation?) And style (background, border...) Notes also could be bitmap or vector images or SVGs. You could add links between notes, and reposition notes using some force-directed graph drawing algorithm. And have infinite level of zoom, where smaller notes are displayed only when you zoom in, and disappear when you zoom out. I imagine that this maybe could be used not only for concept mapping, but for working with code, where you have functions call other functions, and they are organized into classes, modules, packages etc... So when you have architecture of some system of the screen where you see relations between microservices, you zoom in and see packages of microservice, zoom in again - see classes \u0026#x26; functions, zoom in again - see implementation of method on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now I just have a blog. Hugo maps markdown into HTML for me, but blog enforces chronological structure. Removing dates from notes will not help, because in blog notes are published, or not published, they are not evergreen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you, dear reader, store your thoughts and work on your notes?\u003c/p\u003e"},{"id":"microservices_pros_cons","title":"To split or not to split?

This could be achieved by designing service boundaries properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo have proper boundaries, you should model your services around business domain, so the changes that involve different services become less likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePopular 3-layer architecture of front-end (UI), back-end (business logic) and storage (Database), is contrast to this, because most of the time adding some new feature involves changing each layer. For example to display new field, it needs to be added to UI, to back-end for processing, and to database schema. But this architecture is so popular because of Conway's law: \"Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure\", and the fact that organisations often had developers grouped into departments by their qualification - database administration, UI design, etc... Instead it's better to build around business departments - warehouse, sales, accounting, etc...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the outside of the service boundary microservice should look like a black box. It should hide as much information as possible and share as little as possible. Information could be shared by API endpoints or messages in message queues. Each microservice should own their own state. Sharing single database between different microservices is a big no no. This is intended to make changing internal implementation very easy, and is similar to concept of encapsulation in OOP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat size should microservices be? Well, small, so they could be easily understood, but there is no exact measure. Size should depend on purpose and architecture and is not very important concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicroservices require some supporting tech:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLog aggregation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDistributed tracing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContainers and orchestration\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreaming (event queues)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCloud infrastructure\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMonoliths\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonolith\u003c/strong\u003e is opposite concept - anything that is not independently deployed. Monolith could be implemented in many ways: it could be developed as single application, it could be built from multiple independently developed modules or it could be \u003cstrong\u003edistributed monolith\u003c/strong\u003e: bunch of services that does not share code, and could be located on different hosts but still have to be de deployed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContrary to popular opinion that monolith is a bad thing and often associated with legacy, it is not legacy. Actually, it should be default choice, and you should have reasons to not use monolith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonoliths have lots of serious advantages, like simplicity, avoiding problems of distributed systems, better code reuse inside monolith (if you need function, you just call it, no need for copy-paste or creating external library).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to choose?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAdvantages of microservices\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should use microservices if you want to allow developers independently work on their parts of the software, so they don't get in each ones way. One developer could want to do a deployment to fix a bug, but other could want to wait with deployment, because there is unfixed bug in master branch that needs to be fixed first.

It is a story of a family divided by the wall, and their reaction to the fall of the wall. Mother of the family who strongly believes into the values of DDR, has accident and falls into a coma. She spends months in hospital without consciousness, and when she wakes up, the wall is gone. Her son tries to hide that fact from her, because that would make her worry to much, and could lead to another accident. His efforts are the source of the humor of this film. All the rest is the drama about how the family tries to live through the time of changes. It is also educational, as it lets viewer to learn the facts about period in German history, and explains German ostalgie (nostalgie for the old times of DDR), without criticizing or mocking it. It features the music of Yann Tiersen, which fits it very much, as it makes you to have fun and in the same time make you sad and nostalgic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife thinks that we moved to Berlin because I wanted to better immerse myself into the cinematic universe of \"Good Bye, Lenin!\". That could partially be true, as this is one of my favorite movies, I rewatched more, then I have seen main character wake up in the Groundhog Day. So when I walk through the Karl-Marx Allee I think: \"Oh, probably here they lived!\". This feature everything Berlin is - world-famous healthcare in Charite, night clubs in weird facilities, picking up free trash stuff from the street, dumping your trash on the street, IKEA furniture and soft drinks as an vanguard of capitalist conquest of the socialistic city that is ongoing till today. Plot of the film is described by it's title, and if you don't know who or what Lenin is - it is symbol for socialism, the wall and all the bad and good stuff that comes with it. But the main hero, Alex, don't want his mother to know that it's time to say to the wall \"Good bye\". So Alex goes for help to his friend, Denis, who is big fan of the film \"The Matrix\" inferring from his T-Shirt. Together they create their own rea-life version of the Matrix, and put Alex's mother in there. Will she break from the Matrix? I won't tell you to not spoil the film.
